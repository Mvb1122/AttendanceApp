# AttendanceApp
Just a lil thing I whipped up that scans a QR Code and then marks that person off of a list.
Note, this was designed for a Student list taken from APS's Synergy system. As I'm not a teacher, I don't know how the data is fed in or extracted, but yeah.

Also, if you're looking for the actual files, they're in [app/src/main/](https://github.com/Mvb1122/AttendanceApp/tree/main/app/src/main), since this is an IntelliJ project.
(The Java's under "java" and my assets, layouts and stuff are under "res".)
